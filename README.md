## Lolspeak

For this project, I will be building an English-to-Lolcat translation engine. It will take a regular english .txt file and translate it into Lolcat (regardless of length). [This](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/normansimonr/Dumb-Cogs/master/lolz/data/tranzlashun.json) glossary contains over 2000 words and for any non-equivalents, they will be left as they are.
